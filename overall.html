				<h2>Hi There!</h2>
				<p>I'm Lorenzo G. Mora, a seasoned web developer specializing in Angular web development and .NET Core
					Web API development. With a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly digital solutions, I
					bring a comprehensive skill set and years of experience to the table.</p>
				<br>
				<p>My journey in web development has equipped me with a diverse range of skills. I excel in Angular web
					development, where I leverage the framework's powerful features to create dynamic and responsive web
					applications. From crafting intuitive user interfaces to implementing complex functionalities, I
					strive to deliver seamless experiences that meet the unique needs of each project.</p>
				<br>
				<p>One of my key areas of expertise lies in payment processor integration. I have extensive experience
					in seamlessly integrating payment processors such as Stripe, Payfort, SkipCash, PayU, Transbank, and
					others. Ensuring secure and efficient transactions across different countries is a priority, and I
					leverage my expertise to implement robust payment solutions that drive business growth.

					In addition to web development, I am also well-versed in website localization and ADA/WCAG
					compliance. Understanding the importance of reaching diverse audiences and ensuring accessibility
					for all users, I prioritize website localization to tailor digital content to different markets and
					languages. Moreover, I adhere to ADA and WCAG compliance standards to ensure that websites are
					accessible to users with disabilities, enhancing inclusivity and usability.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Proficiency</h2>
				<p>My proficiency extends to backend development, particularly in .NET Core Web API development. I
					architect and implement scalable and secure server-side solutions that support the functionality of
					web applications. Whether it's building APIs from scratch or optimizing existing solutions, I
					leverage the capabilities of .NET Core to deliver high-performance backend systems.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Quality assurance is another aspect of my expertise. I am proficient in automated testing using
					Cypress and employ rigorous unit testing methodologies to ensure the reliability and performance of
					web applications. Additionally, I am familiar with tools such as SonarQube, Compodoc, and Snyk,
					which I use to enhance code quality, documentation, and security.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Overall, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality, secure, and accessible web solutions that drive
					business success. With a focus on innovation, efficiency, and user satisfaction, I am committed to
					bringing your digital projects to life and helping you achieve your goals.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Feel free to reach out to discuss how I can contribute to the success of your projects. Let's
					collaborate and build something great together!</p>
